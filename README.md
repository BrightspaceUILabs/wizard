## Installation

To install from NPM:

```shell
npm install @brightspace-ui-labs/wizard
```

## Usage

Include the [webcomponents.js](http://webcomponents.org/polyfills/) polyfill loader (for browsers who don't natively support web components), then include necessary components:

```html
<head>
  <script src="@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs/webcomponents-loader.js"></script>
  <script type="module" src="@brightspace-ui-labs/wizard/d2l-wizard.js"></script>
  <script type="module" src="@brightspace-ui-labs/wizard/d2l-step.js"></script>
</head>
```

### Basic Usage

Add the component to your page

```html
<d2l-labs-wizard id="wizard">
	<d2l-labs-step title="Step 1">
		<p> First step </p>
	</d2l-labs-step>

	<d2l-labs-step title="Step 2">
		<p> Second step </p>
	</d2l-labs-step>
</d2l-labs-wizard>
<script>
	var wizard = document.getElementById('wizard');
	wizard.addEventListener('stepper-next', function() {
		wizard.next();
	});
	wizard.addEventListener('stepper-restart', function() {
		wizard.restart();
	});
</script>
```

## Developing, Testing and Contributing

After cloning the repo, run `npm install` to install dependencies.

To run the app and view the demo page:

```shell
npm run start
```

To lint ([eslint](http://eslint.org/) and [Polymer lint](https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/docs/tools/polymer-cli-commands#lint)):

```shell
npm run lint
```

To lint AND run local unit tests:

```shell
npm run test
```

## Versioning, Releasing & Deploying

All version changes should obey [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) rules.

Releases use the [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/) tooling and the [angular preset](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/tree/master/packages/conventional-changelog-angular) for commit message syntax. Upon release, the version in `package.json` is updated, a tag and GitHub release is created and a new package will be deployed to NPM.

Commits prefixed with `feat` will trigger a minor release, while `fix` or `perf` will trigger a patch release. A commit containing `BREAKING CHANGE` will cause a major release to occur.

Other useful prefixes that will not trigger a release: `build`, `ci`, `docs`, `refactor`, `style` and `test`. More details in the [Angular Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#type).
